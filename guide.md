this is a guide on how I studied and passed my Goethe exam in 8 months. some people might take more, some might take less. I’m gonna explain step by step, including my daily routine on how I studied the language. I only did the B2 exam and nothing else in between.

**Durations**  
A1 - 2 weeks to 1 month  
A2 - 2 weeks to 1 month  
B1 - 1–3 months  
B2 - 1–3 months (1–1.5 months of grammar and courses, the rest for practicing for the exam)

**My main resources:**

* **Anki Deck (REQURIED)** \- [English-German (Sorted by Frequency) - AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1431033948)
* **Grammar**
   * **Deutscheins / Deutsch1 -** I bought Deutsch1 online courses, it has pre-recorded courses (not necessary) 
   * [Learn German](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnGermanOriginal) (youtube ch.) - This channel has all the grammar you need to pass the exam, I always watch these videos as much as Deutscheins and I think it is really nice for those people who are on budget.

* 2 am sleep.

**HOW TO PRACTICE SPEAKING** \- read mit erfolgt for speaking phrases that can be used in any topics, it will tell you a lot of them but just pick 2 or 3 and stick to it.

* First part, presentation, exam only last 5 mins, super chill
   * First just copy the topics and assigments into chatgpt and make it generates, read and speak to yourself out loud, you will start to see that the topics are so similar to each others and they use a lot of the same words. do this first the first few weeks
   * Later try to do the practice without looking by coming up with the introduction (already there in my google doc) then think of 3 different examples with 1 advantages and 2 disadvantages of each, pick one that u think its the best, summarize it (come up with a template)
* 2nd part, debate
   * like first part, write out like 4-5 advantages and 4-5 disadvantages of ur topics so that u will have an idea of what ur partner will be saying.
   * memorize the phrases from Mit erfolgt, eg ich stimme dir zu, Meine Meinung nach ......, etc
   * done you got this

**HOW TO PRACTICE WRITING** 

* again use chatgpt to create examples, if its too hard then tell chapgt to make it easier but keep it B2 level.
* read each sentence and write each sentence without looking 2-3 times for the first few weeks (NOT PARAGRAPH, READ ONE SENTENCE THEN WRITE THEN READ ANOTHER SENTENCE, later try to write without looking and come up with ur own ideas)
